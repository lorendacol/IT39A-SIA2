              3. Use a Heartbeat Service:
                Check system health without affecting performance.
              4. Avoid language-specific formats: 
                Use JSON or XML for better compatibility.

XML Integration :
                   1. Secure the Transport Layer:

                     Check data using XML rules (XSD) to make sure it's correct and safe.
                   3. Protect Against XDoS Attacks:
                   Limit message size and how often messages are sent to avoid attacks, using security tools to help.
